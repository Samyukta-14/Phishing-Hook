# Phishing-Hook
A Phishing Detection Sytem

Phishing attacks are a prevalent and persistent threat in the cybersecurity landscape, targeting unsuspecting users to divulge sensitive information. In this mini-project, we propose a phishing detection website that utilizes deep learning techniques to detect and prevent phishing attempts. The website includes a trained deep learning model that analyzes web pages for phishing indicators, such as suspicious URLs, misleading content, and fake login forms. The system also features a user-friendly website interface that allows users to input URLs for analysis and receive detection results in real-time. The proposed system aims to provide an effective defense against phishing attacks and protect users from falling victim to such malicious activities.
